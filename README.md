## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Caio!

I'm a **Software Engineer** passionate about solving complex problems and building robust systems.

Over the past five years, I've gained expertise in developing **scalable**, **high-performance**, and **cloud-native** applications. My experience spans a range of languages and paradigms â€” from object-oriented to functional programming â€” and includes working with **Java**, **Kotlin**, **Golang**, **JavaScript**, and **Python**.

I'm currently focused on expanding my knowledge in:

- **Data Engineering**: exploring pipelines, batch/stream processing, and large-scale data systems.  
- **Cloud Engineering**: diving deeper into distributed architectures, automation, and infrastructure-as-code.  
- **System Design**: continuously improving how I approach resilient, maintainable, and cost-effective systems.

I'm particularly enthusiastic about **high-throughput systems** and **data-driven solutions**, where performance, observability, and clarity of design truly matter.
